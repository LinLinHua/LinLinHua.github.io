This project was a hands-on investigation into developing alternative, low-cost fabrication methods for high-performance semiconductor components. The goal was to replace traditional silicon dioxide (SiO₂) with a **High-k dielectric layer (HfO₂)** for use in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Capacitors (MOS-C).

### Core Process & Methodology

My role involved the complete fabrication and analysis workflow:

* **Sol-Gel Spin-Coating:** I fabricated the HfO₂ gate dielectrics using a **Sol-Gel spin-coating process**. This method is scalable and offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques.
* **Test Structure Development:** Developed complete MOS-C test structures used for electrical characterization.
* **Electrical Analysis:** Conducted rigorous electrical analysis, including **C-V (Capacitance-Voltage) and I-V (Current-Voltage) measurements** to evaluate device performance. This was used to determine the dielectric constant (k-value) and leakage current density, which were then compared directly against the performance of traditional SiO₂ films.
