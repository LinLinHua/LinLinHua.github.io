This project report aligns with my research conducted at the National Chiao Tung University Electrophysics Lab, where I performed advanced mathematical and computational analysis on structured light fields. The core objective of this work was to:

**"Visualize particle propagation and behavior in 3D space using MATLAB, applying advanced mathematics to summarize findings on wave patterns and vortex structures in astigmatic transformations of Hermite-Gaussian beams."**

This post will detail the theoretical underpinnings of this project, focusing on the Hermite-Gaussian ($$\text{HG}$$) mode and the critical step of its **astigmatic transformation** to generate **optical vortices**.

### The Hermite-Gaussian (HG) Fundamentals ($$\text{HG}_{00}$$)

The $$\text{HG}_{m,n}$$ family of modes describes the transverse electromagnetic ($$\text{TEM}$$) solutions within stable laser resonators. The lowest-order mode, the **Pure Gaussian Beam ($$\text{HG}_{00}$$)**, is the fundamental mode utilized in this research as the input for conversion processes. It represents the most compact, diffraction-limited beam profile.

#### Intensity and Propagation Parameters

The intensity $$I(r, z)$$ of the $$\text{HG}_{00}$$ mode is defined by the following Gaussian decay function:

$$
I(r, z) = I_0 \left( \frac{w_0}{w(z)} \right)^2 \exp \left( - \frac{2r^2}{w(z)^2} \right)
$$

The beam's propagation is characterized by the **Rayleigh Range** ($$z_R$$) and the **Beam Waist** ($$w_0$$), dictating its spreading ($$w(z)$$) and far-field divergence ($$\theta$$):

$$
z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{\pi w_0}
$$

The evolution of the beam radius $$w(z)$$ as it propagates from the waist is described by:

$$
w(z) = w_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)^2}
$$

### The Role of Astigmatic Transformation

The core of this project involved converting Cartesian $$\text{HG}$$ modes into cylindrical **Laguerre-Gaussian ($$\text{LG}$$) modes**—a process achieved using an **Astigmatic Mode Converter (AMC)**, typically comprising two cylindrical lenses. This transformation is mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{HG}_{n, m} \xrightarrow{\text{AMC}} \text{LG}_{p, l}
$$

Where the radial index $p$ and the azimuthal index $$l$$ (topological charge) are determined by $$n$$ and $$m$$.

#### Generation of Optical Vortices

The transformation is essential because $$\text{LG}$$ beams possess **Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)**, which manifests as a **phase singularity**, or **optical vortex**, at the beam's center. This singularity is a point of zero intensity where the phase is undefined, carrying a topological charge $$l$$.

My work focused on analyzing the resulting **wave patterns** and **vortex structures** using advanced mathematical modeling, which was then computationally realized and visualized in **MATLAB**. This included analyzing the subtle shifts in phase and intensity distributions that influence particle trapping and manipulation dynamics.

The astigmatic transformation converts patterns like $$\text{HG}_{1,0}$$ into the donut-shaped $$\text{LG}_{0,1}$$ mode, thereby generating a measurable optical vortex (phase singularity).</p>

### Summary of Computational Findings

The analysis confirmed that the **wave patterns** generated were stable solutions, and the phase structures could be predicted accurately. Using MATLAB, the visualization of the particle trajectories in the 3D potential well generated by these vortices validated the theoretical models of OAM transfer and micro-particle manipulation.
