Hello! I'm Lin-Lin Hua.

I am a Master's student at the **University of Southern California (USC)**, specializing in the **Machine Learning & Data Science** track within the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, cloud engineering, and the hardware that powers them.

### My Story: From Silicon to Efficient Machine Learning

My journey into data began not with software, but with the silicon itself. As a **Process Engineer at Lam Research**, I worked hands-on with advanced CMOS and dry etch processes, giving me a foundational understanding of semiconductor technology.

This hardware background sparked my interest in computation, leading me to pursue advanced ML research at **Imperial College London**. As a Research Assistant for the INHALE team, I **co-authored a paper on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to analyze multi-dimensional air pollution data. We analytically compared the performance of WGANs against AutoEncoders, RNNs, and CNNs.

At USC, my focus is on building and deploying scalable, end-to-end AI systems. My most recent project, **ReceiptInbox**, is a full-stack, serverless application built on AWS. As the lead for the backend and ML integration, I designed the **asynchronous processing pipeline using SQS and Lambda** and integrated **AWS Textract (OCR) and Bedrock (NLP)** to automatically parse and categorize expenses.

This hands-on work has crystallized my ultimate research focus: **Efficient Machine Learning**. I am dedicated to bridging the gap between algorithm and hardware by focusing on **Quantization and Transformer Compression**. My goal is to leverage my unique perspective—understanding both the semiconductor process and the high-level neural network architectures—to develop novel algorithms like **GPTAQ** for ultra-low bit compression, ensuring that large-scale AI is deployable and sustainable on custom hardware.
